The Uniswap V3 whitepaper introduces a new version of the Uniswap protocol, which is designed to provide greater capital efficiency, customization, and flexibility for automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The paper builds on the concepts introduced in the previous versions of the Uniswap whitepapers and proposes several new features and improvements.

One key feature of Uniswap V3 is the introduction of concentrated liquidity, which allows liquidity providers to concentrate their funds within a certain price range, rather than providing liquidity across the entire price spectrum. This allows for greater capital efficiency and reduces the amount of capital required to provide liquidity.

Another key feature of Uniswap V3 is the introduction of multiple fee tiers, which allows liquidity providers to choose a fee tier that best reflects their risk tolerance and trading strategy. This can help to incentivize liquidity provision for less-liquid tokens and trading pairs.

The Uniswap V3 whitepaper also introduces a new oracle design, which allows for greater customization and flexibility in determining the price of assets. This can help to improve the accuracy of price quotes and reduce the risk of manipulation.

Other improvements proposed in the Uniswap V3 whitepaper include better gas efficiency, more granular control over liquidity provision, and the introduction of position management tools for liquidity providers.

### Move: A Language With Programmable Resources

The Move whitepaper introduces a new programming language designed for implementing smart contracts on the Libra blockchain. Move is a resource-oriented programming language, which means that it allows developers to define custom resource types that represent assets or other stateful objects that can be owned and manipulated by smart contracts.

One of the key features of Move is its support for programmable resources, which allows developers to write code that enforces constraints on how resources can be used or transferred. This makes it possible to build smart contracts that are more secure and less prone to bugs or attacks.

Another key feature of Move is its support for linear types, which provide a way to manage resources more efficiently and prevent certain types of bugs, such as double-spending or resource leaks. Linear types ensure that each resource is used exactly once, which helps to prevent resource duplication or loss.

Move also includes several other features designed to support the development of secure and scalable smart contracts, including a simplified syntax, support for modules and namespaces, and an integrated testing framework. The Move virtual machine is designed to execute contracts efficiently and can support a wide range of use cases, from simple transactions to complex multi-party contracts.

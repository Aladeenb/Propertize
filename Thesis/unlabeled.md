## Useful oneliners

- **Data abstraction:** the process of creating abstract interfaces for a data type that hide the implementation details of that type, while providing a simpler and more intuitive interface for its users. This allows users to work with the data type without having to understand the underlying implementation details, making it easier to use and understand.

- **Compiler vs Interpreter:** A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution, while an interpreter translates and executes the source code line by line during runtime. This means that compilers usually result in faster execution times, but require more time upfront to compile the code, while interpreters can start executing code faster, but may run more slowly due to the interpretation overhead.
